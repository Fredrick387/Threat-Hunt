<details>
<summary id="-flag-1">🚩 <strong>Flag 1: Initial Access via Compromised Service Account</strong></summary>

### 🎯 Objective
Establish initial foothold on target endpoint using compromised credentials.

### 📌 Finding
ProcessCreated event observed on sys1-dept endpoint initiated by account 5y51-d3p7. The activity represents the first recorded action in the attack chain, indicating successful credential compromise and initial access to the environment.

### 🔍 Evidence
| Field | Value |
|------|-------|
| Host | sys1-dept |
| Timestamp (UTC) | 12/1/2025, 3:13:33.708 AM |
| ActionType | ProcessCreated |
| DeviceId | 1d0e12b505d61c7eb1f1fd7842d905c99f6ae26a |
| Initiating Account | sys1-dept\5y51-d3p7 |
| AccountSid | S-1-5-21-805396643-3920266184-3816603331-500 |
| TenantId | 60c7f53e-249a-4077-b68e-55a4ae877d7c |

### 💡 Why it matters
This event marks the initial access phase of the intrusion, aligning with **MITRE ATT&CK T1078 (Valid Accounts)**. The use of account 5y51-d3p7 suggests credential theft or compromise occurred prior to this activity. The timing (early morning hours) and the fact this is the earliest observed event in the timeline indicates this is the attacker's entry point. The AccountSid ending in -500 indicates a built-in Administrator account, representing high-privilege access from the start of the compromise.

### 🛠️ Detection Recommendation
**Hunting Tip:**  
Pivot on the compromised account (5y51-d3p7) across all logs to identify the full scope of unauthorized activity. Query authentication logs (IdentityLogonEvents) to determine where and when this account authenticated prior to this event. Look for anomalous logon patterns such as impossible travel, unusual source IPs, or logons outside normal business hours. Correlate process creation events with this account to map the attack chain progression.

<summary id="-flag-2">🚩 <strong>Flag 2: Remote Session Source Attribution</strong></summary>

### 🎯 Objective
Identify the remote session source information tied to the initiating access on the first endpoint.

### 📌 Finding
Remote session activity detected on sys1-dept originating from external IP address 192.168.0.110. The session was established under the compromised account 5y51-d3p7, with the `IsInitiatingProcessRemoteSession` flag confirming remote execution context. This metadata reveals the attacker's source infrastructure used to access the compromised endpoint.

### 🔍 Evidence
| Field | Value |
|------|-------|
| Host | sys1-dept |
| Timestamp (UTC) | 12/3/2025, 1:24:53.664 AM |
| InitiatingProcessAccountName | 5y51-d3p7 |
| IsInitiatingProcessRemoteSession | true |
| LocalIP | 10.0.0.12 |
| RemoteIPType | Public |
| RemoteIP | 192.168.0.110 |

### 💡 Why it matters
This finding maps to **MITRE ATT&CK T1021 (Remote Services)** and provides critical attribution intelligence. The remote IP 4.150.155.223 represents the attacker's infrastructure or compromised staging system used to access the environment. Remote session metadata is essential for identifying the attack origin, blocking active threat actor infrastructure, and correlating activity across multiple incidents. The public IP classification confirms external access rather than lateral movement from another internal system. This data point enables defenders to pivot across all telemetry sources to identify the full scope of connections from this malicious source.

### 🔧 KQL Query Used
```kql
let startTime = todatetime('2025-12-01T03:13:33.7087736Z');
let endTime = todatetime('2025-12-03T08:29:21.12468Z');
let badUser = "5y51-d3p7";
let firstCompromisedDevice = "sys1-dept";
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where DeviceName == firstCompromisedDevice
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName == badUser
| where TimeGenerated >= startTime + 24h
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, IsInitiatingProcessRemoteSession, LocalIP, RemoteIPType, RemoteIP
```

### 🖼️ Screenshot
<img src="uploads/1769913464418_image.png">

### 🛠️ Detection Recommendation
**Hunting Tip:**  
Pivot on the source IP 4.150.155.223 across all network telemetry to identify additional compromised accounts or systems. Query IdentityLogonEvents and DeviceLogonEvents for authentication attempts from this IP. Hunt for remote session indicators (`IsInitiatingProcessRemoteSession == true`) combined with external IPs to detect similar attack patterns. Correlate with threat intelligence feeds to determine if this IP is known malicious infrastructure. Check firewall logs for persistence of connections from this source and identify any other internal systems contacted.

<summary id="-flag-3">🚩 <strong>Flag 3: Support Script Execution Confirmation</strong></summary>

### 🎯 Objective
Confirm execution of a support-themed PowerShell script from a user-accessible directory.

### 📌 Finding
PowerShell execution detected on sys1-dept with an execution policy bypass executing a script named "PayrollSupportTool.ps1" from the user's Downloads directory. The command line indicates deliberate evasion of PowerShell security controls to execute the malicious payload.

### 🔍 Evidence
| Field | Value |
|------|-------|
| Host | sys1-dept |
| Timestamp (UTC) | 12/3/2025, 6:07:15.565 AM |
| AccountName | 5y51-d3p7 |
| ProcessCommandLine | "powershell.exe" -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\users\5y51-D3p7\Downloads\PayrollSupportTool.ps1 |

### 💡 Why it matters
This activity represents **MITRE ATT&CK T1059.001 (Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell)** and **T1204.002 (User Execution: Malicious File)**. The use of `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` is a classic defense evasion technique that circumvents PowerShell's built-in script execution restrictions. The script name "PayrollSupportTool.ps1" follows social engineering naming conventions designed to appear legitimate. Execution from the Downloads folder indicates the script was likely delivered via phishing, malicious download, or copied during the remote session. This marks a critical escalation point where the attacker transitions from remote access to executing custom tooling on the compromised system.

### 🔧 KQL Query Used
```kql
let startTime = todatetime('2025-12-01T06:27:31.1857946Z');
let endTime = todatetime('2025-12-03T08:29:21.12468Z');
let badUser = "5y51-d3p7";
let firstCompromisedDevice = "sys1-dept";
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == firstCompromisedDevice
| where AccountName == badUser
| where TimeGenerated between (startTime .. endTime)
| where ProcessCommandLine has "powershell"
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, ProcessCommandLine
```

### 🖼️ Screenshot
<img src="uploads/1769915136997_image.png">

### 🛠️ Detection Recommendation
**Hunting Tip:**
Hunt for PowerShell executions with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`, `-ep bypass`, or `-exec bypass` flags across the environment. Query DeviceFileEvents to identify when PayrollSupportTool.ps1 was created or modified to determine delivery method. Extract and analyze the script contents from endpoint or backup sources. Pivot on Downloads directory executions combined with script file extensions (.ps1, .bat, .vbs, .js) to identify similar malicious script activity. Look for child processes spawned by this PowerShell execution to map post-exploitation activity.
