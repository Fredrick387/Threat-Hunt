<details>
<summary id="-flag-1">🚩 <strong>Flag 1: LATERAL MOVEMENT - Remote Access</strong></summary>

### 🎯 Objective
Attackers pivot to critical infrastructure to eliminate recovery options before deploying ransomware.

### 📌 Finding
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(45d)
| where RemotePort == 22
| where RemoteIP has "10." or RemoteIP has "172." or RemoteIP has "192."
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, RemoteIP
| order by TimeGenerated asc

### 🔍 Evidence

| Field | Value |
|------|-------|
| Host | azuki-adminpc |
| Timestamp | 2025-11-25T05:39:11.0836084Z|
| Process | ssh.exe |
| Parent Process | Unknown |
| Command Line | "ssh.exe" backup-admin@10.1.0.189 |

### 💡 Why it matters
This activity maps directly to **MITRE ATT&CK – TA0008: Lateral Movement**, specifically **T1021.004: Remote Services – SSH**. Adversaries who obtain valid credentials frequently use SSH to move laterally within internal networks because it is trusted, encrypted, and often poorly monitored. 

In ransomware and destructive intrusion campaigns, attackers deliberately pivot to backup servers and administrative systems via SSH to disable recovery mechanisms, exfiltrate credentials, or stage payloads prior to impact. Detection of unexpected SSH-based lateral movement is therefore critical for identifying hands-on-keyboard activity during the pre-encryption phase of an attack.

### 🔧 KQL Query Used
```

### 🛠️ Detection Recommendation

**Hunting Tip:**  
Baseline which hosts and user accounts are authorized to initiate SSH sessions to internal systems. Alert on new or rare SSH connections originating from user workstations, especially when targeting backup servers, domain controllers, or other high-value infrastructure, and correlate with credential use, privilege escalation, and subsequent destructive activity.

<summary id="-flag-2">🚩 <strong>Flag 2: LATERAL MOVEMENT - Attack Source</strong></summary>

### 🎯 Objective
Identifying the attack source enables network segmentation and containment.

References:

T1021.004: Remote Services - SSH

### 📌 Finding
10.1.0.108

### 🔍 Evidence

| Field | Value |

### 🛠️ Detection Recommendation

**Hunting Tip:**  
When investigating lateral movement, always pivot on the source host and local IP address to anchor attacker activity. Use the identified source system to review process execution, authentication events, and outbound network connections around the same timestamp to determine whether the workstation is an initial foothold or a secondary pivot point. Confirm whether this host routinely initiates remote access sessions or if the behavior is anomalous, and prioritize containment of the source system to prevent further lateral spread.

<summary id="-flag-3">🚩 <strong>Flag 3: CREDENTIAL ACCESS - Compromised Account</strong></summary>

### 🎯 Objective
Administrative accounts with backup privileges provide access to critical recovery infrastructure.

### 📌 Finding
backup-admin

### 🔍 Evidence

| Field | Value |

### 🛠️ Detection Recommendation

**Hunting Tip:**  
Identify administrative or service accounts that are used interactively (SSH, RDP) rather than through automated services. Baseline expected usage of backup and recovery accounts, and alert when they are observed initiating remote sessions from user workstations or accessing systems outside their normal scope. Correlate account usage with privilege level, time of day, and lateral movement patterns to detect credential compromise early.

<summary id="-flag-4">🚩 <strong>Flag 4: DISCOVERY - Directory Enumeration</strong></summary>

### 🛠️ Detection Recommendation

**Hunting Tip:**  
Monitor for interactive enumeration commands (e.g., ls, find, dir) executed on backup servers, especially when initiated shortly after new remote access sessions. Baseline normal administrative activity on backup infrastructure and alert when file listing or discovery commands target known backup directories outside of routine maintenance windows, as this often precedes destructive actions.
